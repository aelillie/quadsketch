# QuadSketch analysis project

A University project on the QuadSketch algorithm from the paper:
"Piotr Indyk, Ilya Razenshteyn, Tal Wagner, "Practical Data-Dependent Metric Compression with Provable Guarantees", NIPS 2017"

## Report
"report/" contains the actual report of the project, including the finding, contributions and results.

## Source code
"src/" contains the original algorithm by Piotr Indyk, Ilya Razenshteyn, and Tal Wagner.

## Instruction for execution
Instructions as given in the original README:
1. Run /datasets/download.sh to download the datasets
2. In src, compile and run qs.cpp. For example: qs -i ../datasets/sift -o sift_results.txt -n 8 -d 7 -l 5
