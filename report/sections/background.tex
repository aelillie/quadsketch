%What is the research area?
Many applications use algorithms to find distances between data points in a (typically large) data set in order to extract knowledge based on this. One example is doing similarity search on pictures to recognize letters or numbers. As useful as this is, it still depends on the given data, which are getting increasingly big in size. This is a general problem as even modern machines are not able to process \textit{gigantic} files all at once(i.e. keeping all the data in main memory). Thus another big subject in computer science arises, that is compressing the data in order to fit in memory while trying to preserve as much information from the data as possible. This research area is what \qs{} specifically deals with.
