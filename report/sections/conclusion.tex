\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Empirical experiments have verified the results found in \cite{wagner17} in regards to \qs{} on the included datasets, \mnist{} and \sift{}. Furthermore the expected performance for \qs{} has been verified for other datasets, \gist{} and \clust{}.

The implementation of \qsr{} shows an improvement over \qs{} due to the modified decompression step. The effect of this modification is proven to have a lower distortion. The improvement has been observed in empirical experiments using \qsr{}, most significantly on the dataset \mnist{}.
