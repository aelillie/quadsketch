\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Empirical experiments have verified the results found in \cite{wagner17} in regards to \qs{} on the included datesets\footnote{\mnist{} and \sift{}}. Furthermore the performance shown for \qs{} in the results holds for other datasets\footnote{\gist{} and \clust{}}.

A slight improvement to \qs{} in performance has been observed in empirical experiments using \qsr{}, most significantly on the dataset \mnist{}. An expected performance gain is illustrated in section \ref{exp:dist}.
