\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Empirical experiments have verified the results found in \cite{wagner17} in regards to \qs{} on the included datesets\footnote{MNIST, SIFT, Diagonal and NYC Taxi}. Furthermore the performance shown for \qs{} in the results holds for other datasets\footnote{GIST and Clusters}.
\\

A slight practical improvement to \qs{} in performance has been observed in empirical experiments using \qsr{}. The improvements are greatest on the dataset MNIST.
