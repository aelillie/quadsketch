\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Empirical experiments have verified the results found in \cite{wagner17} in regards to \qs{} on the included datesets\footnote{\mnist{}, \sift{}, \texttt{Diagonal} and \texttt{NYC Taxi}}. Furthermore the performance shown for \qs{} in the results holds for other datasets\footnote{\gist{} and \clust{}}.
\\

A slight practical improvement to \qs{} in performance has been observed in empirical experiments using \qsr{}. The improvements are greatest on the dataset \mnist{}.
