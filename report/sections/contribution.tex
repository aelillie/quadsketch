%Short section about our final findings and contributions
%This section describes the contributions given to \qs{} as the results for this project.
This project contributes with a verification of the results found in \cite{wagner17} using \qs{}. Furthermore an extension of \qs{} called \qsr{} is implemented, where the decompression step has been modified. Instead of placing zeros for pruned points, which are deemed insignificant in the pruning step (called \textit{long edges} in the paper), a bit is inserted at random. Empirical experiments constitute a comparison of \qs{}, \grid{} and \qsr{} which show slight improvement from the latter over \qs{}.

%TODO: add table with numbers of improvement !
