This section discusses the findings presented in \ref{results}.

\subsection{Threats to validity}

\subsubsection{Randomness}
\label{disc/threats/randomness}
The comparison of the algorithms shown in \ref{results} show single test runs of the algorithms with different sets of parameters. The seemingly positive results for \qsr{} are inherently subdued to some randomness and could wary on further test runs. However the same applies to \qs{} in the randomly shifted grid, which can have effect on the outcome of single runs. \qsr{}'s added layer of randomness facilitates the possibility of both worse and better outcomes than \qs{}.

\subsubsection{Generated dataset}

\subsubsection{Depth of quad in experiments}
