\section{Future Work}
\label{futurework}
This section will discuss what future work can be done as an extension to this paper and to \cite{wagner17}. Two new contributions will be shortly introduced and their main obstacles described. 

\subsection{Dynamic Addition}
Through the creation of this project some discussions has taken place regarding the possibilities of dynamically adding new points to the finished sketch without recomputing the entire datastructure. Computing the sketch is a very expensive operation, specifically for datasets with many dimensions and a high aspect ratio, as these require a larger tree to obtain propper metrics. This heavy compution currently limits the applications of \qs{} is therefore to static datasets. With the ability to dynamically add points would allow for further usages of \qs{}, and would therefore be a valuable contribution.  

\subsection{Automatic Parameters}
