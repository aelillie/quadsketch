\subsection{Experiment verification}
\subsubsection{Baseline comparison}
The paper compares the \qs{} performance with other compression algorithms, including \textit{Product Quantization} (\pq{}) and a simple baseline algorithm they call Grid. In order to verify their results, a version of Grid has been implemented as baseline to use for replication experiments. The basic concept is as followsâ€¦ And is implemented as follows...
