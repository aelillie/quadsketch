\section{Modification of the \qs{} decompression}
\label{qsr}
\subsection{\qsr{}}
An implementation of \qs{} with a modified approach to represent insignificant bits for a node in the \qt{} has been implemented in \texttt{qsr.cpp}. Section \ref{finding_improvements} described the method for obtaining this, and this section will properly introduce the extension to the algorithm and why it should yield practical improvements in some scenarios.

This experiment focuses on the pruning step for long edges in the source code. Recall that \qs{} shifts each point in a quad towards the lower left corner by replacing existing bits with zeros. The alteration introduced in this experiment moves each point in a quad towards a random corner in that quad. More precisely, by not only introducing zeros into the bit string as replacement, this feature inserts random bits into the bit string. The modification in the implementation is subtle and is illustrated in listing \ref{lst:qsr} below, which is extracted from lines 91-99 in \texttt{qsr.cpp}:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pruning with random bits},label={lst:qsr}]
if (long_edge_length >= lambda && parts.size() == 1)
{
	if (rand()%2)
{
	new_p[j] += 1.0 / (2.0 * (1 << depth));
}
	continue;
}
new_p[j] += 1.0 / (2.0 * (1 << depth));
\end{lstlisting}

This will for each dimension of a node that is pruned, insert a random bit. This might improve the resulting sketch by "pulling" the point in an arbitrary direction for each dimension rather than only distorting them in one direction. This could improve the preservation of distances between points within a quad. A visualization of this can be seen on figure \ref{fig:randombits}, where the transformation by \qs{} is referred to as QS. In the graphical representation each point lies next to each other if they are placed in the same corner, where in the actual transformation these will have the exact same coordinates.

The given example in figure \ref{fig:randombits} demonstrates a scenario where \qsr{} performs decently. It should be noted that the random movement of the points could also result in a worse representation. Such a scenario is discussed in \ref{disc/threats/randomness}.
\\
\\
The motivation behind this experiment stems from the creation of the randomly shifted hypercube in \qs{}. Should the creation of the \qt{} accidentally quad through closely clustered points then the distortion could be quite severe. By introducing randomness into the direction of the points, they might end up in corners closer to each other and thereby reduce the amount of distortion.

\subsection{Expected Distance}
\label{exp:dist}
This sections provides a proof of \qsr{} having a lower expected distance distortion of pruned points than \qs{}. 

Consider some bit string \textit{B} of length \textit{n} which has been removed by \qs{} pruning for one dimension. Consider \textit{k} = $2^n$. Let the range \textit{r} of \textit{B} be defined as 0 to k-1. The expected Euclidean distance \textit{$d_B$} from the bit string of zero's inserted by \qs{} to \textit{B} can be formalized as\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\#Finite_case}}:
\\
$$E[\textit{$d_B$}] = \sum_{i=0}^{k - 1} \dfrac{i}{k}$$
\\
%\textit{$d_B$} can as such be reduced to $\dfrac{k-1}{2}$
The expected Euclidean distance \textit{$d'_B$} from B to the bit string inserted by \qsr{} can be described as the distance from B to some random bit string \textit{B'} with the same length \textit{n}. There are k different values for \textit{B} and for each of these some distance to the k different values for \textit{B'}. This gives a collection of distances \textit{D} of size $k^2$ where $\forall{}_{\textit{d}\in{}\textit{D}}$ $0\leq{}d\leq{}k-1$. As such \textit{$d'_B$} can be formalized as:
\\
$$E[\textit{$d'_B$}] = \sum_{d\in\textit{D}}^{}\dfrac{d}{k^2}$$
\\
Replacing removed bits with 0 will always guarantee the same expected distance to an arbitrary value. However for \qsr{} the introduction of random bit replacement chooses any value in \textit{r}. Values between 0 and k-1 has a lower average distance to some random value, than the boundary values of 0 and k-1. Hence E[\textit{$d'_B$}] $<$ E[\textit{$d_B$}], where $n>1$.
