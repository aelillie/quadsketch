\section{Results}
\label{results}
%From ILO:
%"Plan and carry out a small-scale investigation of an algorithmic research problem. This investigation could be theoretical, experimental, or both."
This sections provides the results reached, in form of the developed heuristics, as well as verification of \qs{}.

%\subsection{Practical improvements}
%Instead of randomly shifted ( works well for arbitrary, but maybe we know our data )
%On specific datasets:
%- Scale on spread out datasets, to avoid one point in each quad leaf
%- Zoom in on narrow / close datasets
