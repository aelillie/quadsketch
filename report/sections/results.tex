\section{Results}
\label{results}
%From ILO:
%"Plan and carry out a small-scale investigation of an algorithmic research problem. This investigation could be theoretical, experimental, or both."

\subsection{Practical improvements}
%Instead of randomly shifted ( works well for arbitrary, but maybe we know our data )
%On specific datasets:
%- Scale on spread out datasets, to avoid one point in each quad leaf
%- Zoom in on narrow / close datasets
